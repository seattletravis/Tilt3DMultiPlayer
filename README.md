# ***TILT3D by TRAVIS LAMBERTE***
### *You can play Tilt3d here: [PLAY TILT3D](https://travis.lamberte.com/tilt3dMenu/index.html)* 
<br>

### *Tilt3d is a web browser puzzle game for 1 or 2 players. It includes a scoring system to make the game more challenging. Til3d is written in JavaScript, HTML and is built using Vite, npm, and node to manage packages and build the application. Tailwind is used for styling.*

<br>

### *Game development in 3D with a physics engine. Tile3d uses the open source 3D renderer “threeJS” and “CannonES” for the physics engine. Some animation is done using the GSAP module. Most of the scoring functionality is written in JavaScript.*

<br>

### *This project marks my first public git repositories on GitHub. As well as my first playable games on my website. Tilt3d is challenging, take that into consideration when you go to play it for the first time.*

<br>

### *Why? I'm currenlty trying to get a job as a software engineer, I enjoy working on games and design. This game gives me the chance to show case web development skills using a game as the focus. Playing Tilt3d is as simple as typing in a web address, however the browser is a non uniform environment to develop. In the future I'll be developing games in python, & C++.*
